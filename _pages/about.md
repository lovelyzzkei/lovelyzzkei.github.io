Hi. This is Chanyoung Jung. Welcome to my site!

I'm currently a M.S. candidate in Computer Science at Yonsei University in Seoul, South Korea. I am member of the <a ref='https://mobed.yonsei.ac.kr/'>Mobile Embedded Systems Lab</a> under the supervision of Prof. Hojung Cha. I received the B.S degree in Computer Science at Yonsei University in 2024. I graduated Cum Laude from Yonsei University.

My research interests include on-device machine learning, mobile augmented reality, and 3D vision with mobile systems. If you want more information about me, please explore my online CV or email me at <a href='mailto:march11381@gmail.com'>march11381@gmail.com</a>. Thanks!
